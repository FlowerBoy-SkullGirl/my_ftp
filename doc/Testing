Tests can be run by invoking 'make run_tests'
You may need to run 'make drivers' first if you don't have hash_driver compiled.

Hash_Driver:
	Takes small_test_file and small_test_file corrupted and tests their hash to ensure that the hashing algorithm can detect differences between the two files.

checksum_small_test.sh:
	Is a script that runs the server and client without the -q option and subsequently checks to see if the file transmitted(small_test_file) was transferred successfully without corruption by comparing sha256sum output.
