INIT AND HANDSHAKE PROCESS PLAN

  Connect to Socket
  Establish a connection/session id
    The server will store this id in either a queue or hash table(undecided)
      The queue will be easy to manage and keep track of which connection was established first
      The hash table will allow for indexing by socket id
  Check for version compliance
  Transmit a file
    File name
    File size
    File data
    EOF
    Loop if there are more files to send
  Close session
