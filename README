My FTP!
Send files over a network socket!
The protocol is not encrypted, so send files with caution. Sensitive data is better sent over ssh or sftp.

Server: requires no command line arguments to use default port 4414
	Port can be specified with -p [number]
	Number of waiting connections can be specified with -c [number]
	Can be run in quiet mode with -q which writes output to "serverlog"
	-h for Help message
Client: command [server-ipv4] [--options] /path/to/file [/path/to/more/files] ....
	By default, pathname will not be preserved once sent over network
	Pass --no-hash to not calculate and send a file hash to the server.
	Pass --full-paths to send the paths of the files to the server.
